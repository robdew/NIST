# NIST Special Publication 800-41 Revision 1
# Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy

## Recommendations

* Create firewall policy that specifies how firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network traffic.
    * Policy should be based on a risk analysis of traffic
* Identify all requirements that should be considered when determining which firewall to implement.
    * Different firewalls for different traffic.
    * Consider expansion and interconnection like VPNs, IPV6
* Rulesets should support policy but account for firewall performance
    * Rulesets should be as specific as possible.
    * Should account for "heavy hitter" rules
* Manage the firewall and its components throughout their lifecycle
    * Monitor performance
    * Continuously monitor logs and alerts
    * Rulesets and policies should follow formal change management
    * Periodically review rulesets and policies
    * Patch your stuff

## Overview of Firewall Technologies

* Discusses OSI layers and protections for each
* More advanced firewalls operate on more layers
* FISMA and PCI require firewalls

### 2.1 Firewall Technologies

* Firewalls are often combined with NAT (which is routing, not firewall) and IPS
* Perimeter firewalls have an external/unprotected and internal/protected interfaces
    * This isn't always true if firewalls enforce policies bidirectionally

### 2.1.1 Packet Filtering

* AKA Stateless firewalls. They are old.
    * Stateless filters can't detect much malicious or spoofed traffic
* Packet filters can dropped fragmented traffic.  Such traffic is used to disguise attackes.
    * VPN can cause fragmented traffic, a common problem with firewalls and VPNs   
* Packet filters employ rulesets and access control lists
* And ACL has a source, destination, protocol and for TCP/UDP, port info.
* Inbound = ingress, Outbound = egress
* Organizations should only permit outbound traffic that uses source addresses of the organization.
* Some firewalls can reassembled fragmented packets, at a cost to resource usage

### 2.1.2 Stateful Inspection

* Packets are expected to follow a specific state, this inspection blocks packets that don't follow
* State of connection is maintained in a state table, typically these entries:
    * source IP
    * destination IP
    * port numbers
    * connection state
* If you are in the state table you bypass rules
* If you don't follow the rules for state you get dropped
* NAT includes state information in the NAT table
* UDP is stateless, but firewalls have some techniques for tracking connections to prevent bad traffic

### 2.1.3 Application Firewalls

* Perform stateful protocol analysis, deep packet inspection
* Can deny traffic based on content
* Can detect DOS
* Can enforce RFC-based rules on protocols
* Different from IPS which can detect behavior anomalies

### 2.1.3 Application Proxy Gateways

* Proxies are intermediaries that never allow connections between endpoints
* Meant to be transparent
* Can require authentication
* Can perform inspection
* Offers higher level of protection since it prevents connections and inspects the traffic
* Can intercept TLS
* Some can cause performance hit on certain types of apps
* Often do not support newer protocols

### 2.1.5 Dedicated Proxy Servers

* More limited firewall capabilities
* Many are applicaiton-specific
* Can be used to decrease firewall workload
* Inbound proxies are in declining used
* Outbound proxies are more common

### 2.1.6 Virtual Private Networking

* Secure specific traffic flows between two networks
* Provides authentication and integrity
* Almost always across untrusted networks
* Common types:
    * IPsec
    * SSL/TLS
* Two types:
    * gateway to gateway
        * usually multiple fixed sites like branch offices 
    * host to gateway
        * Secure connection for individual users
        * Usually user-based access rules
        * Sometimes VPN traffic doesn't traverse firewall rules
        * Often use RADIUS
* Adding a VPN to a firewall requires extra system resources for encryption and traffic volume

### 2.1.7 Network Access Control

* Allowing access based on user credentials
* Or health checks of systems
* Granting limited access is an option for failed checks

### 2.1.8 Unified Threat Management (UTM)

* Combines many controls into one system/policy
* reduces complexity
* increases feature set required for a single system

### 2.1.9 Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

* Specialized firewalls for web servers

### 2.1.10 Firewalls for Virtual Infrastructures




NAT should be considered a form of routing, not a firewall
Firewalls and Network Architectures
Firewalls are used to separate networks with differing security requirements
Firewalls should be placed at the edge of logical boundaries, immediately before traffic enters the router
Network Layouts with Firewalls
The traffic moving between the DMZ and other interfaces on the protected side of a firewall still goes through the firewall and can have protection policies applied
DMZs typically contain public-facing servers
If a network's architecture is not hierarchical, the same firewall policies should be appliecd to all ingresses on the network. Otherwise malicious traffic can get in if someone accidentally sets up an ad-hoc ingress point not protected by the first firewall (in the layer).
Firewalls Acting as Network Address Translators
NAT should be able to report in the private addresses of connections in the firewall logs
Architecture and Multiple Layers of Firewalls
Fundamental to defense-in-depth
Outer and inner firewalls require good planning and policy coordination. For example, the outer firewall admin modifies policy without notifying the inner firewall admin, who assumes that traffic is still being blocked.
Increases the complexity of tracing firewall problems
Firewall Policy
IP Addresses and Other IP Characteristics
Traffic with invalid source or destination addresses should always be blocked
Link-local (169.254.0.0/16) addresses should be blocked
Inward RFC1918 addresses should be blocked.
Egress traffic with invalid source addresses should be blocked to prevent spoofed addresses from leaving the network.
Incoming connections with a destination address of the firewall itself should be blocked unless the firewall is also a proxy
IP source routing and broadcast addresses should be blocked at the perimeter.
Deciding which addressed should be blocked is often the most time-consuming aspect of developing firewall policies
IPV6
Firewalls should be able to block IPv6 traffic and both 6-to-4 and 4-to-6 tunnelling.
Organizations that do not use IPv6 should block all native and tunnelled IPv6 traffic.
ICMP
Orgs usually deny ICMP traffic at the perimeter
ICMP type 3 should not be blocked, because many applications use it for speed optimization and diagnostics
ICMP within the organization's network should generally not be blocked by firewalls not at the perimeter.
IPSEC
Orgs that use IPsec should block ESP and AH except to and from specific addresses on the internal network.
Policy Based on Applications
If possible, firewalls and proxies should be used in front of servers that don't have adequate security features.
Proxies need to be more robust than the servers they are protecting.
Outbound proxies are useful for detecting inappropriate or dangerous connections from inside a protected network.
Most organizations should employ HTTP proxies
Policies Based on User Identity
Firewalls that enforce policies based on user identity should be able to reflect those policies in their logs.
Policies Base on Network Activity
Example: connection throttling
Firewall Planning and Implementation
Plan
Use devices as they were intended. (Routers should not be firewalls)
Created defense-in-depth. Use multiple firewalls
Pay attention to internal threats
Document the firewall's capabilities
Keep in mind that "all rules are meant to be broken" also applies to firewalls.
Pre-purchase considerations
Security capabilities
Management
Performance
Integration
Physical Environment
Personnel
Future needs
Policy Configuration
Port filtering should be enabled at the outer edge of the network
Content filtering should be done as close as possible to the content receiver
Logging and Alerts Configuration
Whenever possible logs should be central and shipped off to another server
You may not want to log all incoming malicious traffic because there is no response to it.
Alerts to firewall admins should occur when the policy is modified, there are operational issues (disk shortage, reboots), and secondary system status changes, if applicable.
Test
The document outlines a skeleton test plan.
MANAGE
Patches should be tested.
Performance should be monitored
all policy and ruleset changes should be logged, and that log should be associated with the firewall
Firewall policies should be reviewed often, at regular intervals
Overall rulesets should be audited by people
Tools are available to do some of this.
Perform penetration testing to assess the overall security of the firewall in its environment.
