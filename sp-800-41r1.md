# NIST Special Publication 800-41 Revision 1
# Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy

## Recommendations

* Create firewall policy that specifies how firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network traffic.
    * Policy should be based on a risk analysis of traffic
* Identify all requirements that should be considered when determining which firewall to implement.
    * Different firewalls for different traffic.
    * Consider expansion and interconnection like VPNs, IPV6
* Rulesets should support policy but account for firewall performance
    * Rulesets should be as specific as possible.
    * Should account for "heavy hitter" rules
* Manage the firewall and its components throughout their lifecycle
    * Monitor performance
    * Continuously monitor logs and alerts
    * Rulesets and policies should follow formal change management
    * Periodically review rulesets and policies
    * Patch your stuff

## Overview of Firewall Technologies

* Discusses OSI layers and protections for each
* More advanced firewalls operate on more layers
* FISMA and PCI require firewalls

### 2.1 Firewall Technologies

* Firewalls are often combined with NAT (which is routing, not firewall) and IPS
* Perimeter firewalls have an external/unprotected and internal/protected interfaces
    * This isn't always true if firewalls enforce policies bidirectionally

### 2.1.1 Packet Filtering

* AKA Stateless firewalls. They are old.
    * Stateless filters can't detect much malicious or spoofed traffic
* Packet filters can dropped fragmented traffic.  Such traffic is used to disguise attackes.
    * VPN can cause fragmented traffic, a common problem with firewalls and VPNs   
* Packet filters employ rulesets and access control lists
* And ACL has a source, destination, protocol and for TCP/UDP, port info.
* Inbound = ingress, Outbound = egress
* Organizations should only permit outbound traffic that uses source addresses of the organization.
* Some firewalls can reassembled fragmented packets, at a cost to resource usage

### 2.1.2 Stateful Inspection

* Packets are expected to follow a specific state, this inspection blocks packets that don't follow
* State of connection is maintained in a state table, typically these entries:
    * source IP
    * destination IP
    * port numbers
    * connection state
* If you are in the state table you bypass rules
* If you don't follow the rules for state you get dropped
* NAT includes state information in the NAT table
* UDP is stateless, but firewalls have some techniques for tracking connections to prevent bad traffic

### 2.1.3 Application Firewalls

* Perform stateful protocol analysis, deep packet inspection
* Can deny traffic based on content
* Can detect DOS
* Can enforce RFC-based rules on protocols
* Different from IPS which can detect behavior anomalies

### 2.1.3 Application Proxy Gateways

* Proxies are intermediaries that never allow connections between endpoints
* Meant to be transparent
* Can require authentication
* Can perform inspection
* Offers higher level of protection since it prevents connections and inspects the traffic
* Can intercept TLS
* Some can cause performance hit on certain types of apps
* Often do not support newer protocols

### 2.1.5 Dedicated Proxy Servers

* More limited firewall capabilities
* Many are applicaiton-specific
* Can be used to decrease firewall workload
* Inbound proxies are in declining used
* Outbound proxies are more common

### 2.1.6 Virtual Private Networking

* Secure specific traffic flows between two networks
* Provides authentication and integrity
* Almost always across untrusted networks
* Common types:
    * IPsec
    * SSL/TLS
* Two types:
    * gateway to gateway
        * usually multiple fixed sites like branch offices 
    * host to gateway
        * Secure connection for individual users
        * Usually user-based access rules
        * Sometimes VPN traffic doesn't traverse firewall rules
        * Often use RADIUS
* Adding a VPN to a firewall requires extra system resources for encryption and traffic volume
